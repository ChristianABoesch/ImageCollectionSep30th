Here is a repository consisting of fancy frog images, complete with a one-song soundtrack!

Questions:
1. I've tried to recall how to push all my changes to GitHub via VSCode, but it takes forever and nothing seems to get done. Could you remind me of the right way to commit & push changes?
2. We played around with opening the website via the 'main' branch. I tried doing this as well, but kept getting an error when typing in the 'github.io' url. Could you remind me what should be done to access the webpage this way?
